## What I have learnt while making this project?

> Since this was my first project ever where I have use Tailwind CSS, so it was really challenging, took a lot of time, going through documentation, learning so many minute details, for example learning about group and group-hover. But finally I have completed it. Now on to next one :D 

#

## Time taken to complete this project:
> Around 18 hrs, spread over the last three days, were spent in developing this fully-reponsive Landing Page of Paytm.
